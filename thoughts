Thoughts:

I have been playing for a while with this idea of Polly the Wiper.  What if
you run a whistleblower site and need to encrypt or strip the file of
metadata. The file could still be in memory or data from the file in
memory, possibly even keys in memory which are used to encrypt or decrypt
them, this could out the source, so how to fix this?

Ofcourse there will always be loopholes, but we can try to make realtime
encryption and deleting any information about the encryption of/or file
itself possible and secure.

My 0,02 what does the community think?
